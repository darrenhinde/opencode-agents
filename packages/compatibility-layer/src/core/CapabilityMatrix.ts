 * second, divergent resolver. Callers reach `degradeToBinary` here because a per-capability
 * grant is the matrix's own question ("what survives on this platform?"), answered by the
 * resolver rather than duplicated against it.
 *
 * ## Ownership (settled by subtask 07; subtask 04 flagged the overlap)
 *
 * `Capabilities.ts` is the sole IMPLEMENTATION — one resolver, one fail-closed projection.
 * This module is a re-export SURFACE and nothing more: no logic, no wrapper, no defaults.
 * The re-export is load-bearing rather than convenience —
 * `tests/unit/build/permission-ordering.test.ts` imports `degradeToBinary` from this path by
 * name and pins it to subtask 07, so deleting it would break a green gate. New code should
 * prefer importing from `./Capabilities.js` directly; adapters that need the flat-list
 * projection want `projectToFlatTools`, which is only exported there.
