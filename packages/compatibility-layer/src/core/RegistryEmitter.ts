/**
 * Generates `registry.json` from the canonical `content/agents/**` tree.
 *
 * ─── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Adding a component today means editing `registry.json` by hand, or running
 * `scripts/registry/auto-detect-components.sh --auto-add` — 895 lines of bash that does not
 * GENERATE the registry at all. It APPENDS: it diffs the `.opencode/**` tree against the
 * registry's existing `path` values, parses frontmatter with `sed`/`grep`, and `jq`-appends
 * whatever it did not recognise. Nothing ever re-derives an entry that already exists, so an
 * entry that drifts from its own file drifts forever. That is exactly what happened —
 * `registry.json` carries names, descriptions, tags and dependency lists that no file on disk
 * agrees with any more, and `subagent:batch-executor` is missing outright despite shipping in
 * `.opencode/agent/subagents/core/batch-executor.md` and being depended on by both
 * `openagent` and `opencoder`.
 *
 * This emitter inverts that: the canonical file is the input, the registry entry is OUTPUT.
 * Adding an agent becomes "add one file under `content/agents/`, run the build".
 *
 * ─── Phase 1 scope: agents only ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `install.sh` reads `registry.json` and is the only shipping install path, so the blast
 * radius of a mistake here is "nobody can install". Phase 1 therefore regenerates ONLY the
 * `components.agents` and `components.subagents` arrays — the two the canonical tree actually
 * owns — and carries every other part of the document (contexts, commands, tools, plugins,
 * skills, config, profiles, categories, metadata) through verbatim from the committed file.
 * Later subtasks canonicalise the rest.
 *
 * ─── Which profile list is authoritative ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Profiles are authored twice — `.opencode/profiles/<name>/profile.json` and
 * `registry.json` `.profiles.<name>.components` — and they have drifted on all 5 profiles
 * (`advanced`: 51 vs 68), with neither a superset of the other. This emitter treats
 * `registry.json` as authoritative and never consults `profile.json`, because
 * `registry.json` is the list `install.sh` actually reads (`get_profile_components`,
 * install.sh:292) and `profile.json` is read only by `scripts/registry/check-dependencies.ts`,
 * a script no install path invokes. Generating from `profile.json` would silently change what
 * five profiles install. See {@link ProfileLoader.drift} for the disagreement itself; the
 * reconciliation is a content decision, not an emitter one.
 *
 * ─── Dead refs are repaired in the SOURCE, never here ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Carry non-agent data through verbatim" is the phase-1 contract: this emitter never edits
 * profile lists, even broken ones. The live example was `.profiles.advanced.components`
 * carrying `context:context-system/*`, which expanded to zero matches (the real subtree is
 * `.opencode/context/core/context-system/`). It was repaired 2026-07-17 as a content edit to
 * the committed `registry.json` — the authoritative profile source — not by rewriting it
 * here. Dead refs are reported by {@link ReferenceResolver.resolve} and gated at zero in
 * `tests/unit/build/reference-resolution.test.ts`.
 *
 * ─── Withdrawing an entry, and why it is manifest-gated ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Deleting a canonical source must delete its registry entry, or this emitter reproduces the
 * exact defect it was built to cure: an entry nothing on disk agrees with, lingering forever.
 * But entries are also CARRIED — `agent:eval-runner` ships in `.opencode/agent/eval-runner.md`
 * and sits in the committed registry with no `content/` counterpart, and dropping it would
 * uninstall the eval harness for everyone.
 *
 * By id alone the two cases are indistinguishable: both are "in the base, absent from the
 * canonical tree". The discriminator is `.oac/build-manifest.json` — the same ledger
 * {@link BuildPipeline} prunes generated FILES with. An entry whose `path` the ledger claims
 * was written BY US, so its absence from the tree means its source was deleted and the entry is
 * withdrawn. An entry whose `path` the ledger does not claim was never ours, so it is carried.
 * `eval-runner.md` has never been in the ledger; every generated agent file always is.
 *
 * The ledger rather than `existsSync`, deliberately: at emit time the orphaned FILE has not
 * been pruned yet ({@link BuildPipeline.write} plans before it reconciles), so an existence
 * check would still see the file and carry the entry — the answer would depend on the order two
 * phases happen to run in. The ledger is ordering-independent, and using the same mechanism as
 * file pruning is what keeps `.opencode/**` and `registry.json` from drifting apart.
 *
 * No ledger prunes nothing, matching {@link BuildPipeline}'s rule: no record of having written
 * a file is not evidence that we wrote it, so a first build carries everything.
 *
 * ─── Determinism ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The generated tree stays committed and CI gates drift with `oac build && git diff
 * --exit-code`, so any per-run variation turns that gate into a coin flip (07 Stage 3 /
 * 04 §2.1). Three things guarantee byte-stability here:
 *
 *   - Agent order comes from `oac.id`, not from `readdir`.
 *   - Key order is fixed: owned entries by literal declaration order, everything else by the
 *     base document's own order, which makes the emitter a fixed point over its own output.
 *   - `metadata.lastUpdated` is carried from the base, never stamped from the clock. The bash
 *     script did `now | strftime` (auto-detect-components.sh:872), which alone would have made
 *     every rebuild a diff.
