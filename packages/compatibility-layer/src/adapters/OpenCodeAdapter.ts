/**
 * OpenCodeAdapter — emits `.opencode/agent/**` from the canonical `content/agents/**` tree.
 *
 * ## What this adapter does
 *
 * Exactly one thing: it removes the `oac:` block from a canonical agent file and leaves every
 * other byte alone. That is the whole transform. The canonical file is *defined* as
 * "OpenCode-legal frontmatter PLUS an `oac:` block", so the OpenCode emission is the canonical
 * file minus that block — nothing to re-derive, nothing to re-format.
 *
 * ## Why it strips text instead of re-serializing YAML
 *
 * The obvious implementation — parse the frontmatter, delete `oac`, `yaml.dump()` the rest —
 * cannot work here, and the reason is worth recording because it will look like an omission
 * otherwise.
 *
 * The 33 shipped agents are hand-authored, and their YAML carries author decisions no dumper
 * reproduces: `"bash .opencode/skills/task-management/router.sh complete*": "allow"` is quoted
 * while the sibling `contextscout: "allow"` is not; actions are quoted (`"deny"`) where YAML
 * does not require it. A round-trip through `yaml.dump()` renormalizes all of it and every one
 * of the 33 files comes back byte-different. Since `oac build && git diff --exit-code` is the
 * gate this refactor rests on (07 Stage 3), a renormalizing emitter would either fail the gate
 * forever or force a 33-file reformatting commit that buries any real drift in noise.
 *
 * Textual excision makes byte-identity the *default* rather than something chased with
 * special cases, and it keeps comments and blank lines — which a dumper silently discards.
 *
 * The parse still happens: the file is validated against {@link CanonicalAgentSchema} and the
 * emitted result is re-parsed and checked (see {@link OpenCodeAdapter.fromCanonical}). Parsing
 * decides *whether* to emit; it just does not decide the bytes.
 *
 * ## What OpenCode actually accepts — verified against source, not docs
 *
 * Checked against the OpenCode checkout at `/Users/darrenhinde/Documents/GitHub/opencode`
 * (`packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts`, v1.1.48+118 / commit `b9aad20be`) and confirmed
 * live against the installed 1.18.1 binary:
 *
 * - **`name:` is legal.** It is listed in the Agent schema's own `knownKeys` (config.ts:636),
 *   and the markdown agent loader builds `{ name: <path-derived>, ...md.data }` (config.ts:336-338)
 *   — the frontmatter spread comes *second*, so an authored `name:` OVERRIDES the path-derived
 *   one and becomes the key the agent registers under (config.ts:343). Emitting `name:` is
 *   therefore not merely allowed, it is REQUIRED to preserve identity: drop it and `CoderAgent`
 *   silently becomes `coder-agent`, breaking every `task:` rule that names it.
 *
 * - **Unknown keys are NOT rejected.** The Agent schema ends in `.catchall(z.any())`
 *   (config.ts:633) and sweeps anything outside `knownKeys` into `options` (config.ts:654-658).
 *   So `oac:` would not actually break OpenCode. Stripping it is hygiene — keeping build-time
 *   metadata out of an agent's runtime `options` — not a hard requirement. See the report in
 *   the subtask notes: the premise that justified `agent-metadata.json` does not hold.
 *
 * - **The permission vocabulary is OPEN.** `Permission` is a `z.object({...}).catchall(
 *   PermissionRule).or(PermissionAction)` (config.ts:553-580), and `skill` (config.ts:575) and
 *   `question` (config.ts:569) are known keys. Capability names are therefore treated here as
 *   opaque strings — never validated against a closed enum.
 *
 * - **Authored order is load-bearing.** `permissionTransform` (config.ts:541) rebuilds the
 *   permission map from `__originalKeys` precisely to preserve the order the author wrote,
 *   because resolution is last-match-wins. Textual passthrough preserves it exactly.
