/**
 * Golden-file snapshots — per adapter, per agent.
 *
 * Two corpora, on purpose:
 *
 *   1. `fixtures/` + `expected/` — 2 agents x 2 targets, controlled input. These pin the
 *      details a live corpus does not happen to exercise (a deny-all-then-allowlist bash
 *      block that Claude Code cannot represent, and must therefore fail CLOSED).
 *
 *   2. `plugins/claude-code/agents/` — the 7 agents already committed in the flat
 *      tools:/disallowedTools: format. This is a FREE regression corpus: whatever subtask 07
 *      emits must reproduce those 7 files byte-for-byte, and no one had to author an
 *      expectation for it. It is guess-free in a way `expected/` cannot be.
 *
 * ─── On the expected/ files being a specification ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The adapters do not exist yet, so `expected/` was authored from the live formats rather
 * than captured from a run: the OpenCode files mirror `.opencode/agent/**` frontmatter minus
 * the `oac:` block; the Claude Code files mirror `plugins/claude-code/agents/**`. They are a
 * SPEC, and they are red until subtasks 06/07 land. If an adapter emits different-but-better
 * bytes, update these files deliberately and say why in the commit — that is the gate
 * working, not the gate being wrong. What must NOT happen is an adapter being relaxed to
 * match a golden, or a golden being regenerated blindly from adapter output.
 *
 * ─── The tool ordering rule, recovered from the live corpus ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Verified 2026-07-15 against all 7 live agents: `tools:` and `disallowedTools:` are both
 * ordered `Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebFetch, Task`. Every one of the 10 lists
 * across those files is consistent with it, and it is the ONLY total order that is —
 * alphabetical is not (`context-manager.md` is `Read, Write, Glob, Grep, Bash`), and neither
 * is `ToolAccessSchema` field order (which would put Bash before Glob/Grep). Subtask 07 must
 * emit this order or the 7 will not reproduce.
