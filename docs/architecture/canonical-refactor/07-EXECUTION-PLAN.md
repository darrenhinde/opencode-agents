# 07 — Execution Plan (Staged, Test-Gated)

> **Status:** Approved direction — supersedes `05`'s staging where they conflict.
> **Date:** 2026-07-15 · **Branch:** `refactor/canonical`
> Incorporates the `06-REVIEW` verdict: architecture sound, spec not buildable as written.
> Every stage below states its **Why**, the **core features** it must achieve, and the
> **tests that gate it**. A stage is done when its tests pass in CI — not before, not "mostly."

## North Star

**OAC is the build system for AI agent configuration.**
Author agents, permissions, and team context **once** in a neutral TypeScript-parsed format
(`/content/`); compile to every tool a team uses (`oac build --target <tool>`); install and
update on user machines safely (`oac init|add|update`); and **verify** the result actually
loads in each real tool. Never degrade silently.

### Locked platform decisions (this plan)

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Language | **TypeScript everywhere** — kill the 52KB `install.sh`/`update.sh` and the Bun-only APIs | One codebase, testable, cross-platform; bash installers are the root of the Windows bug class (#304, #312) |
| Runtime | **Node ≥ 20** (no Bun requirement) | `npm i -g` must work on a clean machine; Bun coupling defeats npm distribution (15 files to convert, mechanical) |
| Workspace manager | **pnpm** (workspaces + lockfile) | Security: strict non-flat `node_modules` (no phantom deps), `ignore-scripts` by default, single content-addressed store, better lockfile integrity. Replaces the current bun.lock + package-lock.json split |
| Distribution | **npm registry** (`npm i -g oac` / `npx oac`) | Users install with the tool they already have; pnpm is our dev tool, not a user requirement |
| First-class targets v1 | **OpenCode + Claude Code** (+ cheap `agents-md` target) | The two with real users and verified formats. Windsurf CUT from v1 (format never verified against a live install); Cursor = experimental |
| Core product | **Context management** — team standards versioned, installed, updated safely | This is the wedge: "bring your standards, we deploy them to every tool." The generic context library becomes optional starter profiles |
| Verification | **Install-verification matrix** as a product feature (`oac doctor --verify`) and a CI gate | "It installed" ≠ "the tool loads it." Headless real-tool load checks across OS × tool × profile |

## Stage Overview

| # | Stage | Ships | Gate (summary) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Quick wins — stop the bleeding | CI gates, security hotfix, version sync, junk sweep, pnpm workspace | packages-only PR triggers full CI; hotfix live |
| 1 | Spec repair & decisions | Fixed `02` schema, revised `01`/`05`, merge conflict rules, 3 blockers answered | Zero BLOCKING open questions; precedence experiment run |
| 2 | `packages/core` — IR schema + parsers | Zod IR, MVI parser, agent/skill/command/registry loaders | **Corpus test:** every real content file parses |
| 3 | Build pipeline + golden tests | `oac build --target opencode\|claude\|agents-md` for worked agents | Golden snapshots byte-stable; build idempotent; warning counts exact |
| 4 | Content merge & migration | `/content/` seeded from BOTH trees; bridge retired | Generated trees load in real tools; evals pass on generated output |
| 5 | CLI, installer parity & verification matrix | Node-portable `oac init/add/update/doctor`; dependency resolution fixed; 3-OS install e2e | `npm i -g` works on clean Windows/macOS/Linux, no Bun; verify matrix green |
| 6 | Flip source of truth & release | Generated trees uncommitted; bash installers deleted; rollback/pinning story; README rewrite | Fresh clone → `oac build` → clean `git diff`; one version number |

Dependency order is strict 0→1→2→3→4→5→6, but Stage 0 items are independently shippable
today and Stage 1 is documentation/decision work that can overlap Stage 0.

## Stage 0 — Quick wins: stop the bleeding

**Why:** The refactor will be built on the same ungated pipeline that produced the current
drift unless CI is fixed first. A live security gap is shipping to Claude Code users today.
Version drift would suppress the `/plugin update` that delivers any fix. None of this needs
the refactor — it needs a week.

**Core features:**
1. **CI gates for the core packages.** New workflow runs `packages/cli`,
   `packages/compatibility-layer`, `packages/plugin-abilities` tests + lint + typecheck on
   every PR. Add a `packages/` branch to `scripts/validation/detect-pr-changes.ts` (today a
   packages-only PR triggers **zero** checks).
2. **Security hotfix for the live CC `coder-agent` gap** (index finding #10): tighten the
   shipped plugin agent's `tools:`, ship `RECOMMENDED-PERMISSIONS.md` (deny-only snippets),
   changelog advisory. Independent of the refactor.
3. **Version reconciliation** — one version across `VERSION`, root + package manifests,
   marketplace, plugin (currently 5 numbers across 7 files; the plugin cache is *ahead* of
   the marketplace).
4. **pnpm workspace bootstrap.** `pnpm-workspace.yaml` covering `packages/*` +
   `evals/framework`; one `pnpm-lock.yaml`; remove root `package-lock.json`/`bun.lock`
   split. Dev scripts run via pnpm; nothing user-facing changes yet.
5. **Junk sweep:** delete/gitignore `dev/`, `context-findings/`, empty `claude-plugin/`
   stub; archive `docs/planning/` (16 stale synthesis docs) under `docs/archive/`.

**Tests / gate:**
- A PR touching only `packages/**` runs build + tests + lint + typecheck in CI (prove with a
  no-op PR).
- `pnpm install && pnpm -r test` green from a fresh clone.
- One grep proves one version string repo-wide.
- Hotfix verified: shipped CC agent no longer grants unscoped `Edit`, or the documented
  mitigation is published and linked from the README.

## Stage 1 — Spec repair & decisions (docs only, no code)

**Why:** `06-REVIEW`'s verdict is verified: the centerpiece schema rejects the corpus it
describes (19 real dependency refs, all 294 context files), two docs were never revised
after v2 decisions, and the hardest migration task (the merge) has no owner. Writing code
against a self-contradicting spec reproduces the drift we're curing.

**Core features:**
1. **Fix `02`'s schema on paper:** dependency kinds `agent|plugin|config` + wildcard refs;
   `ContextSchema.description`/`name` optional/derived; `targets: []` applicability field on
   every content type; restore `profiles` (with `additionalPaths`/`badge`), `categories`,
   `aliases[]`; define the **implicit-default rule** (no `*` rule present → opposite of the
   decisions present; mixed-without-`*` = parse error).
2. **Revise `01` and `05` to v2:** purge the false "160 agents" (4 sites); rewrite `05`
   Stage 3 as a **merge**, not a copy; delete the "or diff-explained" escape hatch from the
   Stage-2 gate; retract `01`'s `.env` alarm (Q17 closed); align `{pattern,effect}` →
   `{scope,decision}`.
3. **Merge ownership + conflict rules** (per content type, written down): for the 7
   dual-home agents, **CC body wins** (newer, richer, has `<example>` blocks) with
   OpenCode-only fields grafted; skills = union of 16 via `targets:[]`;
   `session-start.sh` preserved into `/content/` hooks.
4. **Answer the 3 blockers:** user projects hold an **editable `content/`** (yes — else
   "author once" dies at the user boundary); `model` **not authorable** — add
   `inference.tier: fast|balanced|deep` preserving the haiku-scouts cost tiering; implicit
   default per item 1.
5. **Run the last-match-wins experiment** against a real OpenCode install (10 minutes;
   currently "confirmed" only by self-citation).
6. **Decide symlinks:** convert the 3 context symlinks to `aliases[]` and fix the 3 files
   referencing alias paths (symlinks silently corrupt Windows checkouts).
7. **Write the rollback story** (marketplace pinning, abort criterion) before anything is
   deleted.

**Tests / gate:** no code tests — the gate is editorial and explicit:
- Zero open questions labelled BLOCKING across `01`–`05` (each of `06`'s F/C/L/G findings
  marked *fixed* or *accepted* in a disposition table appended to `06`).
- The precedence experiment's transcript committed to this directory.
- Merge conflict rules signed off (a table in `08-MERGE-RULES.md`: content type → source of
  truth → conflict resolution).

---

## Stage 2 — `packages/core`: IR schema + parsers (test-first)

**Why:** Everything downstream consumes the IR. `06` proved the previous schema draft
rejected the real corpus — so the corpus test is written **first** and drives the
implementation. This is the forcing function that proves Stage 1 actually worked.

**Core features:**
1. New `packages/core` (pure TS, zero Bun, zero I/O beyond `node:fs`): Zod IR schemas for
   all content types (agent, skill, command, context, tool, hook, registry, profiles).
2. **MVI context parser** with the leading-window rule (line 1, or first line after a
   closing YAML `---`), dual-format merge (MVI wins for its 4 fields), non-strict priority
   enum, `X.Y` version normalization **with a re-emit rule** (`2.0.0` → `2.0` on serialize,
   no churn).
3. Agent/skill/command frontmatter loaders; registry + profiles loader with alias and
   wildcard dependency resolution (`context:core/*`).
4. Capabilities model: Option A ordered rules + scalar/map sugar desugaring; last-match-wins
   resolution; parse-time validation for integer-like scopes and duplicate scopes.

**Tests / gate (all in CI from this stage on):**
- **Corpus test (Layer 1):** every real file parses — 34 agents, 294 context files, 20
  commands, 16 skills, `registry.json` including all 19 previously-rejected dependency refs
  and all 5 profiles. Zero failures, zero skips.
- **Trap tests:** the line-232/line-301 prose-marker files parse with correct (path-derived)
  metadata, NOT the in-body marker; the 3 dual-format files resolve MVI-wins; the
  `Priority: reference` outlier is accepted.
- **Round-trip unit tests:** parse→serialize is byte-identical for a sample of each content
  type (catches the version-churn and `read: allow` omission classes).
- **Capability tests:** `coder-agent`'s deny-all-then-allowlist and `openagent`'s
  ask-with-denies resolve correctly under last-match-wins; implicit-default rule covered by
  explicit cases including the five-denies-no-`*` `edit` block.

---

## Stage 3 — Build pipeline + golden tests (the pipeline proof)

**Why:** `oac apply` is already ~80% of `oac build`. Proving the pipeline on the easiest
and hardest real agents — before migrating 900 files — is the cheapest possible point of
failure. If adapters can't express the real agents acceptably, we find out here for the
cost of a week (see kill criteria).

**Core features:**
1. `oac build --target opencode|claude` re-rooted at `/content/`, built on the existing
   adapters — with `ClaudeAdapter` rewritten to the **plugin layout**
   (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, flat `agents/`, `hooks/hooks.json`, bundled `context/`).
2. **`agents-md` target:** emit a well-formed `AGENTS.md` from the same IR — near-free
   adapter that makes OAC useful to every tool that reads the emerging standard.
3. Warning system: every capability/field drop reported, never silent; `--strict` semantics
   redefined so it is satisfiable (known-expected warnings baselined per target).
4. Fail-closed rules from `03`: omit `Bash` on scoped-bash agents for CC; security-glob
   drops are **build blockers** with explicit `--allow-unsafe-degradation` opt-in.

**Tests / gate:**
- **Golden snapshots (Layer 0):** `code-reviewer` (easy) and `coder-agent` (hard) build
  byte-stable for both targets; snapshots reviewed against the hand-maintained plugin files
  and every diff recorded as an explicit merge decision (no "diff-explained" hand-waving).
- **Warning-count exactness:** `code-reviewer` on CC = 2 warnings; `coder-agent` = 4 — the
  counts from `03`, asserted, not approximated.
- **Idempotence:** `oac build && oac build` = no-op; OpenCode output re-parsed → re-built =
  identical (Layer 2).
- **Security gate test:** building CC `coder-agent` without the opt-in flag **fails** on the
  dropped security globs.

---

## Stage 4 — Content merge & migration (the big sweep)

**Why:** The single highest-risk task (`06` L1/C2): `.opencode/` and `plugins/claude-code/`
have drifted bidirectionally (108 vs 269-line versions of the same agent; disjoint skill
sets; `session-start.sh` exists only on the CC side). It is executed here — against the
written Stage-1 rules — not improvised under deadline.

**Core features:**
1. Seed `/content/` from **both** trees per `08-MERGE-RULES.md`; harvest CC `<example>`
   blocks, the 12 CC skills, 6 CC-only commands, and `session-start.sh`'s six capabilities.
2. **Path tokenization** in bodies *and permission scopes* (`{{SKILL_ROOT}}` etc.) + a lint
   forbidding raw `.opencode/` paths in `/content/` (~129 files affected).
3. Symlinks → `aliases[]`; fix the 3 referencing files.
4. Retire `scripts/bridge/sync-to-claude.sh` — only after golden parity holds.
5. Registry regenerated from `/content/` (closing the 110 unregistered-file gap becomes
   mechanical).

**Tests / gate:**
- Corpus test still green over the merged `/content/` (now the only source).
- **Full-tree structural test (Layer 4):** generated `.opencode/` and plugin trees contain
  every expected file; manifests valid; tokenized paths resolve in both install layouts.
- **Real-tool load (Layer 5, first pass):** OpenCode headless (`@opencode-ai/sdk`) and
  Claude Code load the **generated** trees without error.
- **Evals as the behavior gate:** the existing eval suites run against generated (not
  hand-written) agents; pass rate ≥ current baseline on main.

## Stage 5 — CLI, installer parity & the install-verification matrix

**Why:** This is where the user-facing promise lands: `npm i -g oac` on a clean machine —
including Windows — with no Bun, no bash, safe updates, and working dependency resolution
(today `add.ts` installs a component and **none** of its dependencies; issue #310 is a user
discovering this). And "it installed" must be checkable per tool: your explicit requirement
for a system that tests installation across AI tools lives here as a feature, not a script.

**Core features:**
1. **Node-portability:** convert the 15 Bun-API files (`node:fs/promises`, `node:crypto`,
   `fileURLToPath`); `bin/oac.js` runs on plain Node; fix `bundled.ts`'s package-root
   heuristic (explicit `package.json` name check).
2. **Dependency resolution done right:** transitive walk with cycle detection, wildcard
   expansion, alias resolution; unresolvable ref = hard error (this will surface hidden
   breakage — budgeted).
3. `oac init|add|update|remove|status|doctor` at full `install.sh` parity — absorbing the
   requirements encoded in open PRs #326/#328/#309/#312, then closing them; sha256 manifest
   gating so user edits survive updates.
4. **Install-verification matrix (`oac doctor --verify`):** per detected tool, verify the
   installed output is *loadable* — OpenCode headless session; CC plugin manifest + agent
   frontmatter validation; agents-md well-formedness. Same checks exposed as a CI matrix.
5. Profile-aware context install (`oac init --profile standard`) — the "install the right
   context" UX, with `additionalPaths` actually copied (a parity *improvement* over
   `install.sh`, which only printed them).

**Tests / gate:**
- **3-OS e2e in CI:** `npm i -g` (packed tarball) → `oac init` → `oac doctor --verify` on
  ubuntu, macOS, **windows-latest** — no Bun present. This workflow replaces
  `installer-checks.yml`'s bash jobs.
- Dependency tests: known graph fixtures incl. wildcards, aliases, cycles, unknown refs
  (hard error), and the 3 previously-dead `/add-context` deps now resolving.
- Update-safety test: hand-edit an installed file → `oac update` preserves it; `--yolo`
  overwrites; `--check` reports drift honestly (the determinism/sha256 interaction from
  `06` G6, specified and tested).
- Uninstall test: `oac remove` leaves no orphans (closes the "clean uninstall" ask, #266).

---

## Stage 6 — Flip source of truth, release & rollback

**Why:** Only after everything upstream is green does deleting the old world become safe.
This stage makes the repo *become its own pitch* — and protects the 4.5k-star install base
from a bad auto-updating release.

**Core features:**
1. Stop committing generated trees; delete `install.sh`, `update.sh`, the bridge script;
   `.opencode/` in-repo becomes build output for dogfooding (and the OAC repo itself runs on
   OAC-installed context — the dogfooding gap closes here).
2. **Release topology:** one version; changesets-style release flow via pnpm; marketplace
   entry regenerated from build; **pinning + rollback documented and tested** before the
   first auto-updating release goes out.
3. README rewrite to the positioning: build-system framing, honest comparison, 5-minute
   quickstart per OS, eval badge.
4. PR/issue triage sweep: close the obsoleted installer PRs with pointers; convert the
   spec's QUICK-WINS list.

**Tests / gate:**
- Fresh clone → `pnpm install && pnpm build && oac build` → **clean `git diff`**.
- Release dry-run: pack → install from tarball → verify matrix green on 3 OSes.
- Rollback drill: publish `x.y.z-rc`, then verify a documented pin/rollback path actually
  restores `x.y.(z-1)` for a CC plugin user and an npm user.

---

## Kill / stop criteria (agreed up front)

- **Stage 3 kill:** if golden tests prove the adapters cannot express the real agents
  without unacceptable loss (security semantics or delegation gone on a first-class target),
  STOP — fall back to OpenCode-as-source + docs-generation. Sunk cost ≈ 1–2 weeks, not 2 months.
- **Stage 4 kill:** if the merge reveals the two agent sets are different *products* rather
  than drifted copies, STOP and pick one tool to be great at.
- **New adapters:** only on demonstrated user demand (N real requests), never because a tool
  exists. Windsurf stays cut until its format is verified against a live install.
- **Done line:** IR frozen at v1, two first-class targets + agents-md, one version number,
  boring releases. After that: content, DX, and users — not more infrastructure.

## Working agreements

- Each stage lands as a stack of small PRs into `refactor/canonical`; the branch merges to
  `main` per stage (each stage is shippable), not as a mega-PR (cf. #298, +19k lines, stalled).
- Tests are written before or with the feature they gate — never after the stage "works."
- Any claim about counts/behavior gets verified against disk before it enters a doc
  (the `06` discipline is now house style).
