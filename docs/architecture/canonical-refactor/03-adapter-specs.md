# 03 — Adapter & Transform Specs (Agent C) — **v2**

> **Status:** Specification only — no implementation code. **v2** (realigned to Option A
> permissions + MVI context metadata, per `00-INDEX.md` v2).
> **Scope:** For each of the 4 build targets (OpenCode, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf), the
> complete transform from the neutral IR to the tool's on-disk format, plus a consolidated
> capability matrix and the exact warning text emitted on any lossy transform.
>
> **Read first:** `00-INDEX.md` v2 (locked decisions). Where this doc conflicts with the
> index, **the index wins** — except where this doc raises a *verified contradiction*, which
> is escalated in §0.5 and Open Questions rather than silently resolved.

**v2 changes:** Option A (ordered rule list) replaces the flat `capabilities` model in every
mapping table · new §0.4 (capabilities model) and §0.5 (**ordering-direction contradiction —
blocking**) · OpenCode serialization + ordering analysis (§1.3) · CC collapse rule, the
`coder-agent` bash case, and a **verified negative** on the `settings.json` escape hatch
(§2.6) · new matrix rows for scoped permissions, ask tri-state, rule ordering · census
corrected (34 agents / 20 commands / 296 context) · context bundling corrected to MVI
HTML-comment · worked example re-verified (§2.8).

## 0. Shared Conventions (apply to all adapters)

### 0.1 Neutral IR fields (the input every adapter consumes)

Per `00-INDEX.md` v2 worked example and `packages/compatibility-layer/src/types.ts`:

| Neutral field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string (kebab) | Stable identity; adapters slugify per tool. |
| `name` | string | Human display name. |
| `role` | `primary` \| `subagent` | Operational mode. |
| `category` | enum (`core`,`development`,…) | **Domain** only; distribution tier lives in registry `profiles`. |
| `description` | string | One-line summary. |
| `tags[]` | string[] | Free-form labels. |
| `capabilities` | see §0.4 | Ordered rule lists + scalar sugar. **INTENT, not any tool's syntax.** |
| `inference.temperature` | number \| absent | Sampling temperature. |
| `inference.model` | string \| **null** | `null` ⇒ tool default. **Never hardcode** (locked #2). |
| `inference.maxSteps` | number \| absent | Step cap. |
| `context[]` | `{ path, priority?, description? }` | External context refs. See §0.6. |
| `dependencies[]` | `subagent:` \| `context:` \| `skill:` \| `command:` \| `tool:` | Declared deps. |
| `examples[]` | `{ context, user, assistant }` | Few-shot delegation examples. |
| `hooks[]` | `{ event, command, … }` | Lifecycle hooks. |
| body | markdown | System prompt authored once. |

Verified census (index v2): **34** agents, **20** commands, **296** context `.md`
(286 HTML-comment / 3 YAML / 7 neither), 2 OpenCode skills, ~11 CC plugin skills.

### 0.2 Warning contract

`BaseAdapter.ts:187-208` already defines both templates. **Reuse their exact output** — every
lossy transform below cites the literal string:

```
unsupportedFeatureWarning(feature, value?):
  ⚠️  Feature '<feature>'( (<value>))? is not supported by <displayName>

degradedFeatureWarning(feature, from, to):
  ⚠️  Feature '<feature>' will be degraded: <from> → <to>
```

`<displayName>` ∈ `OpenCode` / `Claude Code` / `Cursor IDE` / `Windsurf`.

### 0.3 Warnings are never silent

A transform that drops or degrades any field MUST emit a warning AND `analyzeCompatibility()`
MUST predict it. Builds fail only on `blockers`; warnings are reported and counted.
**Security-relevant losses (§2.3) are warnings today — see Open Questions #Q3 for whether they
should block.**

### 0.4 The capabilities model (Option A — locked decision #5)

```
capability: <scalar>                    # sugar → [{ scope: "*", decision: <scalar> }]
capability: [ { scope, decision }, … ]  # full ordered form
delegate:   { name: decision, … }       # map sugar → [{ scope: name, decision }, … ]
```
`decision ∈ allow | deny | ask`. Every adapter normalizes sugar → ordered list *first*, then
transforms. Adapters never see the sugar forms.

**Derived concepts every adapter needs:**

- **Default-scope decision** — the decision of the rule whose scope is `*`, if present. This is
  what coarse targets (CC/Cursor/Windsurf) collapse to.
- **Exceptions** — every rule whose scope ≠ `*`. These are what coarse targets lose.
- **Implicit default** — when *no* `*` rule exists. ⚠️ **The IR does not currently define this**,
  and the two real agents disagree on what it should be: `coder-agent.edit` lists only *denies*
  (`**/*.env*`, `**/*.key`, …) and clearly means "edit anything except these" ⇒ default
  **allow**; `code-reviewer.delegate` lists only *allows* (`contextscout`) and clearly means
  "only this one" ⇒ default **deny**. A workable inference rule is *"implicit default = the
  opposite of the decisions present; mixed-without-`*` is an error"* — but this is a **schema
  decision for `02`, not an adapter decision**. Escalated as Open Question #Q2. Every collapse
  rule below depends on it.

### 0.5 ⚠️ BLOCKING CONTRADICTION — first-match-wins vs last-match-wins

**The locked shape says "first-match-wins". Every real agent is authored last-match-wins, and
first-match-wins would break exactly the agents Option A was chosen to protect.**

Verified evidence — `.opencode/agent/subagents/code/coder-agent.md` as authored on disk:

```yaml
permission:
  bash:
    "*": "deny"                                                        # ← broad rule FIRST
    "bash .opencode/skills/task-management/router.sh complete*": "allow"
    "bash .opencode/skills/task-management/router.sh status*": "allow"
```

and `.opencode/agent/core/openagent.md`:

```yaml
  bash:
    "*": "ask"          # ← broad rule FIRST
    "rm -rf /*": "deny"
    "sudo *": "deny"
```

Under **first-match-wins**, `"*": deny` matches every command and the two `router.sh`
exceptions **never fire** → `coder-agent` cannot run `router.sh` → it cannot complete or
report task status. That is precisely the breakage the index cites as Option A's rationale
(*"which would break its ability to run its own router.sh"*). Likewise `openagent`'s
`sudo *: deny` would never fire — `sudo` would resolve to `ask`, a **security regression**.

Under **last-match-wins**, both files behave exactly as authored and intended.

The repo's own planning doc agrees — `docs/planning/12-MASTER-SYNTHESIS.md:442`:

> "The `permission:` field uses **last-match-wins** evaluation (same as OpenCode's native
> system) … Rules are evaluated in order; the LAST matching rule wins. This matches OpenCode's
> permission semantics exactly, ensuring IDE-native compatibility."

**The ordered-list decision is right; the stated match direction is wrong.** Two resolutions:

| | Resolution | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **A (recommended)** | IR adopts **last-match-wins** | Matches OpenCode natively, matches all 34 authored agents **as written**, zero reordering transform, and the index's own `coder-agent` example becomes correct as printed. |
| B | IR keeps **first-match-wins** | The index's `coder-agent` example must be **reordered specific-first** (it is currently broken as printed); the OpenCode adapter must **reverse rule order** on both serialize and parse; and all 34 agents must be order-reversed at migration. Equivalent expressive power, strictly more machinery and one more place to get it wrong. |

**This doc specifies Resolution A (last-match-wins) throughout.** If the coordinator confirms
B, §1.3 gains a reversal step and §0.4's "default-scope decision" becomes "the *last* `*` rule".
Escalated as **Open Question #Q1 — blocking**; it changes generated output for every target.

### 0.6 Context on disk (MVI HTML-comment — locked decision #6)

Context `.md` files carry a single compact metadata line, **not** YAML frontmatter:

```
<!-- Context: standards/code | Priority: critical | Version: 2.0 | Updated: … -->
```

286 of 296 files use this. It is **deliberate** (token efficiency; the model reads it on every
load) and **must not be migrated to YAML**. Consequences for adapters:

- Adapters **copy context files byte-for-byte** — the MVI comment travels with the file and is
  never rewritten into YAML on any target.
- `context[].priority` in the IR is **parsed from this comment** in-memory by the core parser,
  not from frontmatter. Adapters consume the normalized IR value and never re-parse.
- ⚠️ A generic parser (`gray-matter`) finds **no frontmatter** here and silently yields
  `priority: undefined` — which would degrade every priority-ordering claim in this doc to a
  no-op. This is the core parser's contract (`02`), but adapters depending on `priority`
  (OpenCode sidecar, Windsurf `contexts[].priority`) inherit the risk.

## 1. OpenCode Adapter

`.opencode/` is build **output**, not source (locked #1). Real formats inspected:
`.opencode/agent/**`, `.opencode/config/agent-metadata.json`, `.opencode/agent/**/0-category.json`,
`.opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md`, `.opencode/command/*.md`, `.opencode/opencode.json`,
`.opencode/config.json`.

**Highest-fidelity target** — the only one with per-scope allow/deny/ask, temperature,
delegation, external context refs, and skills.

### 1.1 File / directory layout

```
.opencode/
  agent/
    <category>/<id>.md                    # role: primary      e.g. core/opencoder.md
    subagents/<category>/<id>.md          # role: subagent     e.g. subagents/code/reviewer.md
    <category>/0-category.json            # category descriptor
  config/agent-metadata.json              # sidecar: metadata outside the OpenCode schema
  skill/<skill-id>/SKILL.md
  command/<command-id>.md
  context/<category>/<...>.md             # copied verbatim (MVI comment intact) — referenced, not inlined
  opencode.json                           # { "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json" }
  config.json                             # { "agent": "<default primary id>" }
```

File name = `id` (kebab); `name:` frontmatter = PascalCase. Verified against
`agent/core/opencoder.md` (`name: OpenCoder`) and `agent/subagents/code/reviewer.md`
(`name: CodeReviewer`).

### 1.2 Field mapping table

| Neutral field | OpenCode target | Transform rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | file path stem + `agent-metadata.json` key | kebab, unchanged; drives location |
| `name` | `name:` | **id → PascalCase** (`code-reviewer` → `CodeReviewer`) |
| `role` | `mode:` | 1:1 (`primary`/`subagent`) |
| `category` | dir segment + sidecar + `0-category.json` | 1:1 (domain only) |
| `description` | `description:` | verbatim |
| `tags[]` | sidecar `tags` | not in OpenCode agent schema |
| `capabilities` | `permission:` map | **ordered list → map, order preserved** (§1.3) |
| `capabilities.delegate` | `permission.task` | `[{scope:X,decision:D}] → task: { X: "D" }` |
| `inference.temperature` | `temperature:` | verbatim |
| `inference.model` = null | *omit `model:`* | null ⇒ OpenCode default |
| `inference.model` set | `model:` | verbatim |
| `inference.maxSteps` | sidecar (advisory) | no native field |
| `context[]` | `@`-ref / `paths.json` + sidecar `context:<id>` dep | referenced, not inlined |
| `dependencies[]` | sidecar `dependencies[]` | verbatim |
| `examples[]` | body prose / sidecar | no native `<example>` convention |
| `hooks[]` | `.opencode/plugin/` registration | full support |
| body | markdown | verbatim |

### 1.3 Capabilities → `permission:` — exact serialization & ordering

**Answer to the coordinator's question: OpenCode round-trips Option A exactly *in expressive
power*, but its map form preserves ordering only *by convention, not by specification*.**

Serialization is a direct 1:1 emission — for each capability, emit each rule in IR list order
as a `"<scope>": "<decision>"` entry:

```
IR                                                   →  OpenCode
bash: [ {scope:"*",decision:deny},                      permission:
        {scope:"…/router.sh complete*",decision:allow},   bash:
        {scope:"…/router.sh status*",decision:allow} ]       "*": "deny"
                                                             "bash …/router.sh complete*": "allow"
                                                             "bash …/router.sh status*": "allow"
```

Capability→key map: `bash→bash`, `edit→edit`, `write→write`, `delegate→task`. `read`/`grep`/
`glob` are granted by default in OpenCode; emit a key only when a rule is not a plain
`*: allow`. Scalar sugar round-trips as a single `"*"` entry. `ask` is preserved natively —
**OpenCode is the only target that can express it.**

**Ordering preservation — three caveats, in decreasing severity:**

1. **YAML mappings are unordered *by spec*.** The YAML spec defines a mapping as an unordered
   set of key/value pairs. Emitting in list order preserves order *textually*, and the common
   parsers (`js-yaml`, `yaml`) preserve document order into JS object insertion order — so it
   works in practice, and OpenCode's own files rely on it (`"*": deny` first). But
   **order-as-semantics in a map is an implicit contract with OpenCode's parser**, not a
   guarantee. If OpenCode ever normalizes, sorts, or round-trips permission keys through an
   unordered dict, every deny-all-then-allowlist agent silently inverts. This is a real
   fragility in the *target format*, inherited by us — worth stating plainly rather than
   assuming.
2. **Integer-like keys silently jump position.** Per ECMAScript, integer-index-like string
   keys (`"2"`, `"8080"`) are ordered numerically *ahead of* all other string keys regardless
   of insertion order. Real scopes are globs (`*`, `**/*.env*`, `sudo *`) and are never
   integer-like, so this is currently theoretical — but it is a silent, order-inverting failure
   if a scope like `"8080"` ever appears. **Mitigation:** the IR should reject integer-like
   scopes at parse time (cheap validation).
3. **Duplicate scopes collapse.** The IR list can hold the same scope twice with different
   decisions; a map cannot (the later key silently overwrites). **Mitigation:** enforce
   scope-uniqueness-per-capability in the IR schema. Duplicate scopes are meaningless under
   either match direction anyway.

**Conclusion:** with those two cheap IR validations (no integer-like scopes; unique scopes per
capability), OpenCode **round-trips Option A exactly and deterministically**. Without them,
ordering is preserved in practice but is not deterministic-by-spec. Both validations belong in
`02` — Open Question #Q2.

### 1.4 Content-type mapping

**Agents.** Frontmatter per the index worked example (`name`/`description`/`mode`/`temperature`/
`permission`). Because Option A carries scoping in content, **no adapter-injected safety
preset is needed** (locked #5: "safety globs live naturally in content"). This removes the v1
"default safety pattern set" proposal — v1's Open Question on that is **closed**.

**Skills.** → `.opencode/skill/<id>/SKILL.md`, frontmatter `name/description/version/author/
type: skill/category/tags` (verified: `skill/project-orchestration/SKILL.md`).

**Commands.** → `.opencode/command/<id>.md`, frontmatter `description:` only (verified across
the 20 real command files).

**Context.** Referenced, not copied-and-rewritten: files land at `.opencode/context/<path>`
**byte-for-byte (MVI comment intact — §0.6)**; loading is via `@`-import + `paths.json`
(verified in `opencoder.md`: *"paths.json is loaded via @ reference in frontmatter"*);
`context:<id>` recorded in sidecar `dependencies`.

**Hooks.** → `.opencode/plugin/` registration. Full support.

### 1.5 Manifest generation

- `.opencode/opencode.json` — static `{ "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json" }`.
- `.opencode/config.json` — `{ "agent": "<default primary id>" }` (observed: `eval-runner`).
- `.opencode/config/agent-metadata.json` — sidecar: `id/name/category/type/version/author/
  tags/dependencies[]` + `maxSteps` + `context[].priority` + folded `examples`.
- `.opencode/agent/<category>/0-category.json` — `name/description/icon/agents{}` with
  `commonSubagents/commonTools/commonContext`.

### 1.6 Lossy transforms (OpenCode)

| Field | Disposition | Warning |
|---|---|---|
| `inference.maxSteps` | sidecar (advisory; unenforced) | `⚠️  Feature 'maxSteps' (<n>) is not supported by OpenCode` |
| `context[].priority` | sidecar; not enforced at load | `⚠️  Feature 'context priority' will be degraded: ordered load → sidecar metadata only` |
| `examples[]` | folded into body/sidecar | *(none — content preserved)* |

**Capabilities: zero loss** — scopes, ordering, and `ask` all survive (subject to §1.3).
Temperature, delegation, skills, hooks, external context: **full fidelity**.

## 2. Claude Code Adapter

**Authoritative target = the plugin layout**, verified at
`~/.claude/plugins/cache/oac-marketplace/oac/1.0.2/`.

> ### ⚠️ Locked finding (index v2 #4): `ClaudeAdapter.ts` targets the wrong layout
> It writes the **project** layout (`.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/config.json`,
> `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — see `ClaudeAdapter.ts:95-124`). The authoritative format
> is the **plugin** layout (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, flat `agents/`, `hooks/hooks.json`,
> bundled `context/`). **As written it produces something CC cannot load as a plugin.** The
> adapter must be retargeted to §2.1 before any CC output is trustworthy.

### 2.1 File / directory layout

```
<plugin-root>/                       # e.g. dist/claude/ → plugins/cache/oac/<ver>/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json         # plugin manifest

```

### 2.2 Field mapping table

| Neutral field | CC target | Transform rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `name:` + `agents/<id>.md` | **id → kebab-case** |
| `name` | H1 in body | PascalCase, prose only |
| `role` | *(none)* | every `agents/` file is a subagent; `primary` flattens → warn |
| `category` | `plugin.json` keywords | no per-agent field → warn |
| `description` | `description:` `\|` block | folded with `examples[]` as `<example>` blocks |
| `tags[]` | `plugin.json` keywords | merged at manifest level |
| `capabilities` | `tools:` / `disallowedTools:` | **ordered list → coarse allowlist** (§2.3) — lossy |
| `capabilities.delegate` | `Task` in `tools:` | collapse per §2.3 |
| `inference.temperature` | **dropped** | warn |
| `inference.model` = null | omit | harness default |
| `inference.model` set | `model:` | CC alias (`sonnet`/`opus`/`haiku`) |
| `inference.maxSteps` | dropped | warn |
| `context[]` | copied → `context/` + SessionStart hook | **bundled**, not referenced (§2.4) |
| `dependencies[]` | resolved & bundled | `subagent:` deps force-emit that agent file |
| `examples[]` | `<example>` blocks in `description` | verified format (§2.3) |
| `hooks[]` (agent-level) | **dropped** | ⚠️ plugin subagents ignore `hooks` frontmatter (§2.5) |
| `hooks[]` (plugin-level) | `hooks/hooks.json` | full support |
| body | markdown | verbatim |

Capability→tool name (`ToolMapper.ts` `claude.fromOAC`, PascalCased): `read→Read, write→Write,
edit→Edit, bash→Bash, glob→Glob, grep→Grep, delegate→Task`.

### 2.3 The collapse rule — ordered rule list → coarse allowlist

**Verified constraint (CC docs, `sub-agents.md`):** `tools:` and `disallowedTools:` are
allowlists/denylists of **tool NAMES only**. A pattern like `Bash(foo:*)` is **not valid** in
agent frontmatter — argument scoping exists *only* in `settings.json`. So **every scope ≠ `*`
is unrepresentable per-agent in CC.** The only question is which way each capability rounds.

**Rule — round to the default-scope decision (fail-closed on ambiguity):**

1. Normalize sugar → ordered list. Determine the **default-scope decision** (the `*` rule; if
   absent, the implicit default per §0.4 — Open Question #Q2).
2. `default = allow` → tool goes in `tools:`. Any `deny` exceptions are **dropped** → warn.
3. `default = deny` → tool goes in `disallowedTools:`, **omitted** from `tools:`. Any `allow`
   exceptions are **dropped** → warn.
4. `default = ask` → **round to deny** (CC has no per-agent interactive gate) → warn.
5. Exceptions are *never* used to flip the default.

**The `coder-agent` bash case** — `"*": deny` + two `router.sh` allows. The coordinator is
right that neither answer is correct; here is the choice and the justification:

> **Omit `Bash` (fail-closed).** Including `Bash` would grant **unrestricted shell** to an
> agent whose authored intent is "no shell except two exact `router.sh` invocations" — a
> silent privilege **escalation** of the widest possible blast radius, produced by a build
> step the user never inspects. Omitting `Bash` is a **functional regression** (`coder-agent`
> cannot update task status) that is **loud, visible at first use, and recoverable**.
> Asymmetry decides it: a wrong `deny` yields a broken agent; a wrong `allow` yields an agent
> that can `rm -rf` in a repo whose owner believed it was sandboxed. Escalation-by-default is
> never an acceptable build artifact. This also matches what the real plugin already ships —
> `agents/coder-agent.md` has `tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep` (no `Bash`, no `Task`).

**Warnings** (both fire for this case):

```
⚠️  Feature 'scoped bash permissions' will be degraded: 1 default rule + 2 scoped exceptions → coarse tool allowlist
⚠️  Feature 'scoped bash allow-exceptions' (2 rules) is not supported by Claude Code
```

The second warning MUST enumerate the dropped scopes verbatim (`bash …/router.sh complete*`,
`bash …/router.sh status*`) so the loss is auditable, and point at the manual remedy in §2.6.

**The `edit` case is the more dangerous one and is easy to miss.** `coder-agent.edit` lists
*only* denies (`**/*.env*`, `**/*.key`, `**/*.secret`, `node_modules/**`, `.git/**`) with no
`*` rule ⇒ implicit default **allow** ⇒ `Edit` lands in `tools:` and **all five security globs
are dropped**. The CC agent can then edit `.env` and `.key` files that the authored agent was
explicitly forbidden from touching. This is a **silent security downgrade** produced by a
faithful application of the rule, so it must warn loudest:

```
⚠️  Feature 'scoped edit permissions' will be degraded: 5 deny-globs → unrestricted Edit
⚠️  Feature 'edit deny-globs' (**/*.env*, **/*.key, **/*.secret, node_modules/**, .git/**) is not supported by Claude Code
```

See Open Question #Q3: security-glob loss is arguably a **blocker**, not a warning.

**Agents.** Verified frontmatter (`agents/code-reviewer.md`):

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: |
  Review code for security vulnerabilities, correctness, and quality. Use after implementation is complete and before committing.
  Examples:
  <example>
  Context: coder-agent has finished implementing a new auth service.
  user: "The auth service is done, can you check it?"
  assistant: "I'll run the code-review skill to have code-reviewer validate it before we commit."
  <commentary>Implementation is complete — code-reviewer validates before commit.</commentary>
  </example>
tools: Read, Glob, Grep
disallowedTools: Write, Edit, Bash, Task
model: sonnet
---
```

### 2.4 Content-type mapping

**Skills.** → `skills/<id>/SKILL.md`. Verified frontmatter (`skills/code-review/SKILL.md`):
`name / description / context: fork / agent: code-reviewer`. The `context: fork` + `agent:`
keys (isolated forked execution) are CC-specific; the neutral skill IR needs optional
`execution: { isolate?, agent? }` to round-trip them (Open Question #Q5). Supporting `.md`
files copied alongside.

**Commands.** → `commands/<id>.md`, frontmatter `name / description`, body verbatim
(`commands/oac-status.md`). `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` bash blocks preserved verbatim.

**Context — bundled, not referenced.** Unlike OpenCode:
1. every `context[]` entry and every transitive `context:` dependency is **copied byte-for-byte**
   into `context/<category>/…` — **the MVI HTML-comment line travels with the file and is never
   rewritten to YAML** (§0.6);
2. `.context-manifest.json` is generated: `version / profile / source{repository,branch,commit,
   downloaded_at} / categories[] / files{<cat>: <count>}` (verified against the shipped manifest);
3. at runtime `hooks/session-start.sh` (SessionStart) injects the skill catalogue + `using-oac`
   via dual-format JSON — `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` for CC, `additional_context`
   for other tools. `context[].priority` is **not** representable in that payload → dropped.

⚠️ `session-start.sh` has **no OpenCode equivalent** and lives in a directory slated for
deletion (index v2 #3) — it must be preserved into `/content/` first.

**Hooks.** Plugin-level `hooks/hooks.json` → full support; baseline always emits
`SessionStart → bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/session-start.sh"` (timeout 30).
**Agent-level `hooks[]` are dropped** — see §2.5.

### 2.5 Lossy transforms (Claude Code)

| Field / feature | Disposition | Exact warning |
|---|---|---|
| `inference.temperature` | **dropped** (no per-agent temperature) | `⚠️  Feature 'temperature' (<value>) is not supported by Claude Code` |
| scoped rules (scope ≠ `*`) | dropped; default-scope decision wins | `⚠️  Feature 'scoped <cap> permissions' will be degraded: <n> rules → coarse tool allowlist` + an enumerating `is not supported` line |
| `decision: ask` | rounded to deny | `⚠️  Feature 'ask permission' for '<cap>' will be degraded: ask → deny (Claude Code has no per-agent interactive ask)` |
| rule **ordering** | meaningless after collapse | `⚠️  Feature 'permission rule ordering' is not supported by Claude Code` (emit once per agent with any multi-rule capability) |
| `context[].priority` | dropped (hook payload unordered) | `⚠️  Feature 'context priority' (<level>) is not supported by Claude Code` |
| `inference.maxSteps` | dropped | `⚠️  Feature 'maxSteps' (<n>) is not supported by Claude Code` |
| `category` | → keywords/prose | `⚠️  Feature 'agent category' will be degraded: typed category → plugin keywords` |
| `role: primary` | flattened | `⚠️  Feature 'agent mode' will be degraded: primary/subagent → subagent (Claude Code agents/ are all subagents)` |
| **agent-level `hooks[]`** | **dropped — verified** | `⚠️  Feature 'agent hooks' (<n> hooks) is not supported by Claude Code` |

**Verified (CC docs, `sub-agents.md`):** *"For security reasons, plugin subagents don't support
the `hooks`, `mcpServers`, or `permissionMode` frontmatter fields. These fields are ignored when
loading agents from a plugin."* So agent-level hooks are **silently ignored by CC** — the
adapter must warn rather than emit them. `permissionMode` being unavailable also closes off a
possible per-agent scoping route.

**⚠️ Related finding — `settings.json: {"model": "opusplan"}` is probably a no-op.** CC docs
(`plugins.md`, "Ship default settings with your plugin") state that in a plugin-shipped
`settings.json` *"only the `agent` and `subagentStatusLine` keys are supported."* `model` is
not in that list, so the value shipped by the plugin (added in **#264**, commit `40dd267`) is
likely **ignored by CC**. Confidence: **high** on the doc statement, **medium** on it applying
to this exact file (not runtime-verified). If true this is both (a) a live bug worth an issue,
and (b) the answer to v1's Q4 — the question is moot because the key has no effect. Flagged as
Open Question #Q6.

### 2.6 `settings.json` scoped permissions — investigated; **recommend AGAINST**

The coordinator asked whether the adapter can preserve scoping via CC `settings.json`. I
investigated, and the answer is a **verified negative** — it is not available to us at all.

**What's real and confirmed.** `settings.json` genuinely supports scoped rules with
`allow`/`deny`/`ask` arrays. Real examples from this very repo (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
include `Bash(git log:*)`, `Bash(npm test:*)`, and — strikingly — `Bash(bash
.opencode/skills/worktree/router.sh create fix/…)`, i.e. **exactly the `router.sh` scoping
shape `coder-agent` needs**. Syntax: `Tool(pattern)`, gitignore-style globs for path tools,
`:*` a trailing-wildcard form equivalent to ` *`. Precedence is **deny → ask → allow,
first match in that order; specificity does not reorder** — so a broad deny beats a narrow
allow. (Source: `code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions.md`.)

So the shape fits. **Three independent blockers kill it anyway:**

1. **Plugins cannot ship permissions — decisive.** Plugin-shipped `settings.json` supports
   *"only the `agent` and `subagentStatusLine` keys"* (`plugins.md`). OAC's CC target **is a
   plugin**. The adapter therefore **cannot emit permission rules at all** — anything it wrote
   would be ignored. This alone ends the option.
2. **Project scope ≠ agent scope.** Even via the user's own settings, rules are
   managed/local/project/user-scoped — never per-subagent. Restoring `coder-agent`'s intent
   ("deny all bash except two `router.sh` commands") would require `deny: ["Bash(*)"]`
   **project-wide**, breaking every other agent and the user's own shell. The one construct
   that would make it safe — per-agent scoping — is exactly what CC lacks.
3. **The agent allowlist wins anyway.** If `Bash` is omitted from an agent's `tools:`, a
   `settings.json` `Bash(...)` allow **cannot re-enable it** — the frontmatter allowlist is
   what gates the tool. So the escape hatch cannot rescue a fail-closed agent without *also*
   hand-editing its `tools:`. (Confidence: **medium** — CC docs describe subagents as having
   "independent permissions" but do not spell out the interaction; flagged in #Q4.)

**Recommendation — emit documentation, not configuration.** The adapter should generate a
**`RECOMMENDED-PERMISSIONS.md`** (or a README section) containing a copy-pasteable
`settings.json` snippet for the rules that were dropped, and reference it from the warnings.
Constrain it to the **safe direction only**:

- **Hoist `deny` rules that are universal across all agents.** The security globs are already
  near-universal in content (`**/*.env*`, `**/*.key`, `**/*.secret`, `node_modules/**`,
  `.git/**` appear on `coder-agent` *and* `openagent`; `sudo *`, `rm -rf /*` recur too). As
  project-level denies — `Edit(**/*.env*)`, `Bash(sudo *)` — they over-apply in the **safe**
  direction, and CC's deny-first precedence makes them robust. This genuinely recovers the
  §2.3 `edit` security downgrade, *if the user opts in*.
- **Never suggest hoisting `allow` rules.** A project-level `Bash(bash …/router.sh complete:*)`
  would grant that command to **every** agent, including ones authored with no shell at all —
  re-introducing the escalation §2.3 exists to prevent, just one layer up.

Net: **scoping cannot be preserved mechanically for CC.** Fail-closed per-agent (§2.3) plus an
opt-in, deny-only documented snippet is the honest ceiling. Recording this as a closed question
rather than an open one is itself a deliverable — the index currently lists it as open.

### 2.7 Manifest generation

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — `name / description / version / author{name,url} / license /
  repository / homepage / keywords[]` (keywords aggregated from agent `tags` + `category`).
  Verified against the shipped 1.0.2 manifest. ⚠️ Version must be reconciled first — the cache
  is at **1.0.2**, *ahead* of the marketplace entry it builds from (index v2 #6), which would
  suppress the `/plugin update` delivering any fix.
- `hooks/hooks.json` — event→command map; always includes the SessionStart baseline.
- `.context-manifest.json` — see §2.4.
- `settings.json` — see the §2.5 no-op finding.

### 2.8 Worked-example re-verification under Option A

**`code-reviewer` → the index predicts exactly 1 warning (temperature). Under Option A as
specified here it produces 2, and the extra one is load-bearing.**

Walking it: `read/grep/glob: allow` and `edit/write/bash: deny` are all **scalar sugar** ⇒ each
is a single `*` rule ⇒ **no scoping, no ordering, no `ask`** ⇒ they collapse cleanly to
`tools: Read, Glob, Grep` + `disallowedTools: Write, Edit, Bash` with **zero warnings**. That
part confirms the index exactly, and confirms Option A costs nothing for simple agents —
sugar-only agents are warning-free apart from unsupported scalars. `temperature: 0.1` →
**warning 1**.

But `delegate: { contextscout: allow }` is **map sugar for a scoped rule** —
`[{scope: "contextscout", decision: allow}]`, scope ≠ `*`. Its intent is "may delegate to
contextscout **and nothing else**". CC's `Task` is coarse: granting it permits delegation to
**any** agent. So per §2.3 (implicit default = deny, since only allows are listed) `Task` is
**omitted** — which is exactly what the index's `tools: Read, Glob, Grep` shows, and exactly
what the shipped `agents/code-reviewer.md` does (`disallowedTools: … Task`). The output is
right; but dropping a delegation the agent was granted **is** a scoped-rule degradation, and
§0.3 forbids silent loss → **warning 2**:

```
⚠️  Feature 'scoped delegate permissions' (contextscout) is not supported by Claude Code
```

Reconciliation options: **(a) accept 2 warnings** and correct the index — recommended, because
the alternative is either a silent capability drop or (worse) granting unrestricted `Task`; or
**(b)** define delegate→Task collapse as an expected non-warning narrowing — which contradicts
"warnings are never silent" and hides a real loss. **The output artifact is identical either
way; only the count changes.** Open Question #Q7. Note the count is 1 *only* under the v1 flat
model, where `delegate` carried no scope — so this is a genuine, expected consequence of
Option A, not a regression.

**`coder-agent` → 4 warnings**, all from §2.3/§2.5:

| # | Cause | Warning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `temperature: 0` | `⚠️  Feature 'temperature' (0) is not supported by Claude Code` |
| 2 | `bash` `*: deny` + 2 `router.sh` allows → `Bash` omitted (fail-closed) | `⚠️  Feature 'scoped bash permissions' will be degraded: 1 default rule + 2 scoped exceptions → coarse tool allowlist` |
| 3 | `edit` 5 security deny-globs → unrestricted `Edit` | `⚠️  Feature 'scoped edit permissions' will be degraded: 5 deny-globs → unrestricted Edit` |
| 4 | `delegate` allowlist (contextscout, externalscout, TestEngineer) → `Task` omitted | `⚠️  Feature 'scoped delegate permissions' (3 rules) is not supported by Claude Code` |

Resulting file matches the shipped `agents/coder-agent.md` (`tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob,
Grep`) — i.e. **the hand-authored CC plugin already made every one of these choices**, which is
independent corroboration that fail-closed is the right rule. **Warning 3 is the one to act on:**
`coder-agent` on CC is strictly less safe than on OpenCode, and no adapter-side fix exists
(§2.6).

## 3. Cursor Adapter

Described from `adapters/CursorAdapter.ts`, `fixtures/sample-cursorrules`, and `ToolMapper.ts`
`cursor`. **Format carries real uncertainty — see Open Questions.**

Lowest-fidelity target: effectively single-agent, no skills, no hooks, no delegation, no
external context refs, no permission model to speak of.

### 3.1 Layout

- **Legacy (stub's output):** single `.cursorrules` at project root.
- **Modern (likely correct):** `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` — MDC files with `description` / `globs` /
  `alwaysApply` frontmatter.

Multiple neutral agents are **merged into one** (`CursorAdapter.mergeAgents()`): prompts joined
under `# Agent N: <name>`, union of tools, **max** temperature, first non-null model.

### 3.2 Field mapping table

| Neutral field | Cursor target | Transform rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` / `name` | `name:` | verbatim (merged agent) |
| `role` | *(none)* | dropped |
| `category` | *(none)* | dropped |
| `description` | `description:` | verbatim |
| `capabilities` | prose "# Tool Access" list | **default-scope decision only**; all scoping dropped (§3.3) |
| `capabilities.delegate` | dropped | `task` unsupported (`ToolMapper` marks it so) |
| `inference.temperature` | `temperature:` | verbatim; limited range |
| `inference.model` = null | omit | Cursor default |
| `inference.model` set | `model:` | `mapOACModelToCursor` (falls back to `gpt-4`) |
| `context[]` | **inlined** into rules body | copied as prose; MVI comment travels inline verbatim |
| `dependencies[]` | dropped | no dependency system |
| `examples[]` | prose | no native support |
| `hooks[]` | dropped | no hooks |
| body | rules body | verbatim |

Tool names (`ToolMapper.ts` `cursor.fromOAC`): `bash→terminal, read→file_read, write→file_write,
edit→file_edit, glob→file_search, grep→content_search, task→(unsupported)`.

### 3.3 Capabilities under Option A

Cursor has **no enforced permission model** in `.cursorrules` — tools are listed as *prose*, so
even the default-scope decision is advisory. Collapse rule: same as CC §2.3 (fail-closed;
default-scope decision wins; `ask` → deny), then render the resulting allow-set as a prose
list. Every scope ≠ `*` is dropped, and ordering is meaningless. **Cursor is the weakest target
for security intent** — `coder-agent`'s deny-globs become, at best, a suggestion in a rules
file. Open Question #Q8 asks whether `.mdc` `globs:` can carry any of this (it scopes *rule
activation by file*, which is not the same as *permission*, but is the nearest construct).

### 3.4 Content types

- **Agents:** merged; frontmatter `name / description / model? / temperature?` (per fixture).
- **Skills:** none → inlined (warn).
- **Commands:** no native system (Open Question #Q8).
- **Context:** **inlined** under `# Context Files` with `## <path>`, optional `*description*`,
  `**Priority**`, and a "load this file" note. Priority is written as text, never enforced.
- **Hooks / dependencies:** dropped.

### 3.5 Manifest

**None.** `getConfigPath()` → `.cursorrules` (legacy) or `.cursor/`. The rules file *is* the
configuration.

### 3.6 Lossy transforms (Cursor)

| Field / feature | Disposition | Exact warning |
|---|---|---|
| multiple agents | merged | `⚠️  Cursor IDE does not distinguish between primary and subagent modes` (per subagent) |
| scoped rules | dropped | `⚠️  Feature 'scoped <cap> permissions' (<n> rules) is not supported by Cursor IDE` |
| `decision: ask` | → deny | `⚠️  Feature 'ask permission' for '<cap>' will be degraded: ask → deny (Cursor IDE has no interactive ask)` |
| rule ordering | meaningless | `⚠️  Feature 'permission rule ordering' is not supported by Cursor IDE` |
| permissions generally | advisory prose only | `⚠️  Feature 'permissions' will be degraded: enforced allow/deny/ask → advisory prose in rules file` |
| `skills[]` | inlined | `⚠️  Feature 'skills' (<n> skills) is not supported by Cursor IDE` + `💡 Consider inlining skill content into the main prompt for Cursor` |
| `hooks[]` | dropped | `⚠️  Feature 'hooks' (<n> hooks) is not supported by Cursor IDE` |
| `inference.maxSteps` | dropped | `⚠️  Feature 'maxSteps' (<n>) is not supported by Cursor IDE` |
| `capabilities.delegate` | dropped | `Tool 'task' is not supported by cursor` (`ToolMapper`) |
| `context[]` | inlined | `💡 <n> context file(s) referenced - consider loading them manually in Cursor` |

## 4. Windsurf Adapter

From `adapters/WindsurfAdapter.ts` + `ToolMapper.ts` `windsurf`. **Inferred, not verified
against a live install — see Open Questions.**

Mid-fidelity: multiple agents ✅, external context refs ✅; binary permissions,
temperature→creativity, partial skills, no hooks.

### 4.1 Layout

```
.windsurf/
  config.json                    # role: primary
  agents/<id>.json               # role: subagent
  context/<...>.md               # copied byte-for-byte (MVI comment intact)
```
The ecosystem also uses root `.windsurfrules` and `.windsurf/rules/*.md`; the stub commits to
JSON (Open Question #Q9).

### 4.2 Field mapping table

| Neutral field | Windsurf target | Transform rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` / `name` | `name` | verbatim |
| `role` | `type` | `primary`/`subagent` (partial) |
| `category` | `category` | verbatim (enum-validated) |
| `description` | `description` | verbatim |
| `capabilities` | `tools` + `permissions` (binary) | **default-scope decision → boolean**; scoping dropped (§4.3) |
| `capabilities.delegate` | `delegate` tool | partial (`task→delegate`) |
| `inference.temperature` | `creativity` | `≤0.4→low`, `≤0.8→medium`, `>0.8→high` |
| `inference.model` = null | omit | Windsurf default |
| `inference.model` set | `model` | `mapOACModelToWindsurf` (fallback `claude-4-sonnet`) |
| `context[]` | `contexts[]` path refs | referenced under `.windsurf/context/` |
| `context[].priority` | `priority` | `critical/high→high`, `medium/low→low` (4→2) |
| `dependencies[]` | partial | subagent deps → separate JSONs; others dropped |
| `examples[]` | dropped | no support |
| `hooks[]` | dropped | no hooks |
| `skills[]` | `contexts[]` refs | → `.windsurf/context/<skill>.md` |
| body | `systemPrompt` | verbatim |

Tool names (`ToolMapper.ts` `windsurf.fromOAC`): `bash→shell, read→read_file, write→write_file,
edit→edit_file, glob→find_files, grep→search_content, task→delegate`.

### 4.3 Capabilities under Option A

`mapOACPermissionsToWindsurf` produces `Record<string, boolean>` — **binary, unscoped,
unordered**. Collapse: default-scope decision → `allow→true`, `deny→false`, `ask→false`
(bespoke warning below, matching the stub's existing literal). All scope ≠ `*` rules dropped;
ordering meaningless. Same fail-closed asymmetry as CC §2.3: `coder-agent.bash` (`*: deny`)
→ `shell: false`; its `edit` deny-globs (implicit default allow) → `edit_file: true` with the
globs lost.

⚠️ The stub's current granular branch does the **opposite** of fail-closed —
`WindsurfAdapter.ts:511-516` sets `windsurfPerms[tool] = hasAllow` for object-valued
permissions, i.e. **any** `allow` key flips the tool **on**. Under Option A that turns
`coder-agent`'s deny-all-plus-two-exceptions into **unrestricted shell** — the exact
escalation §2.3 rejects. **This branch must be replaced by the default-scope rule**, not
merely re-pointed at the new shape.

### 4.4 Content types

- **Agents:** JSON (`name/description/type/systemPrompt/model?/tools/creativity?/category/
  contexts[]/permissions`).
- **Skills:** degraded → `contexts[]` refs at `.windsurf/context/<skill>.md`.
- **Commands:** no clear equivalent (Open Question #Q9).
- **Context:** referenced, copied byte-for-byte; priority collapsed 4→2.
- **Hooks:** dropped.

### 4.5 Manifest

`.windsurf/config.json` doubles as primary-agent file and de-facto manifest. No dedicated
plugin manifest (Open Question #Q9).

### 4.6 Lossy transforms (Windsurf)

| Field / feature | Disposition | Exact warning |
|---|---|---|
| `hooks[]` | dropped | `⚠️  Feature 'hooks' (<n> hooks) is not supported by Windsurf` + `❌ Windsurf does not support hooks - behavioral rules will be lost` |
| scoped rules | dropped | `⚠️  Feature 'scoped <cap> permissions' (<n> rules) is not supported by Windsurf` |
| `decision: ask` | → false | `⚠️  Permission "ask" for <tool> degraded to false (deny). Windsurf only supports binary on/off.` *(stub literal — preserve verbatim)* |
| rule ordering | meaningless | `⚠️  Feature 'permission rule ordering' is not supported by Windsurf` |
| granular permissions | binary | `⚠️  Feature 'granular permissions' will be degraded: ordered scope rules → binary on/off per tool` |
| `skills[]` | context refs | `⚠️  Feature 'skills' will be degraded: full Skills system → basic context references` |
| `inference.temperature` | → creativity | `⚠️  Feature 'temperature' will be degraded: numeric temperature → creativity (low/medium/high)` |
| `context[].priority` | 4→2 | `⚠️  Feature 'context priority' will be degraded: critical/high/medium/low → high/low` |
| `inference.maxSteps` | dropped | `⚠️  Feature 'maxSteps' (<n>) is not supported by Windsurf` |
| `context[]` | reminder | `💡 <n> context file(s) referenced - ensure they exist in .windsurf/context/` |

## 5. Consolidated Capability Matrix

Extends `CAPABILITY_MATRIX` in `core/CapabilityMatrix.ts`. Cells: **full** / **partial** /
**none**. `oac` = the OpenCode adapter target.

`externalContext: cursor` stays **none** (referencing is unsupported; inlining is captured by
`contextBundling`, not by upgrading this cell — Open Question #Q10).

## 6. Adapter selection & pipeline notes

- `oac build --target <tool>` selects via `AdapterRegistry`; each adapter implements
  `fromOAC(agent) → ConversionResult` (`{ files: ToolConfig[], warnings: string[] }`).
- `analyzeCompatibility(agent, target)` runs first: `blockers` fail the build; `warnings` are
  printed and counted. It must be extended to predict the new rows above — today it has no
  concept of scoped rules and would under-report every Option A agent.
- Whole-repo builds run manifest generation once after per-agent conversion.
- `oac apply` is already ~80% of this pipeline (index v2 #8).

---

## Open Questions

1. **Q1 — first-match-wins vs last-match-wins (BLOCKING; §0.5).** The locked shape says
   first-match-wins; all 34 authored agents and `docs/planning/12-MASTER-SYNTHESIS.md:442`
   say last-match-wins, and first-match-wins would silently break `coder-agent`'s `router.sh`
   allowlist and neuter `openagent`'s `sudo *: deny`. The index's own `coder-agent` example is
   broken as printed under first-match-wins. **Recommend adopting last-match-wins.** This
   changes generated output for every target and must be resolved before `02` or `03` freeze.

2. **Q2 — implicit default + IR validations (§0.4, §1.3).** For `02`: (a) when a capability has
   no `*` rule, is the implicit default allow or deny? `coder-agent.edit` (denies only) implies
   allow; `code-reviewer.delegate` (allows only) implies deny — proposed rule: *"opposite of
   the decisions present; mixed-without-`*` is an error."* (b) Should the IR reject
   integer-like scopes and enforce scope-uniqueness per capability? Both are required for
   OpenCode's map form to round-trip deterministically.

3. **Q3 — are dropped security globs a warning or a blocker? (§2.3)** `coder-agent` on CC gets
   unrestricted `Edit` with `**/*.env*` / `**/*.key` protections silently gone, and no
   adapter-side remedy exists (§2.6). Warning (current spec) or hard blocker requiring explicit
   opt-in?

4. **Q4 — CC agent `tools:` vs `settings.json` interaction (confidence: medium).** If `Bash` is
   omitted from an agent's `tools:`, can a project `settings.json` `Bash(...)` allow re-enable
   it for that agent? Docs say subagents have "independent permissions" but don't specify the
   interaction. §2.6's conclusion holds either way (plugins can't ship permissions), but this
   determines whether the documented manual remedy needs a `tools:` edit too.

5. **Q5 — skill execution metadata.** CC skills carry `context: fork` + `agent: <id>`. Does the
   neutral skill IR gain `execution: { isolate?, agent? }`? Where does it degrade on
   OpenCode/Cursor/Windsurf?

6. **Q6 — plugin `settings.json: {"model": "opusplan"}` is likely a no-op (§2.5).** Docs say
   plugin settings.json supports only `agent` and `subagentStatusLine`. If confirmed, #264 /
   commit `40dd267` shipped a setting CC ignores — worth an issue, and it moots v1's Q4.
   Needs runtime verification.

7. **Q7 — `code-reviewer` warning count: 1 or 2? (§2.8).** Under Option A, `delegate:
   {contextscout: allow}` is a scoped rule; collapsing it to "no `Task`" is a real loss that
   §0.3 says must warn → 2 warnings, not the index's 1. The emitted file is identical either
   way. **Recommend accepting 2 and correcting the index**; the alternative is a silent drop.

8. **Q8 — Cursor: legacy `.cursorrules` vs `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`.** The stub emits legacy
   single-file. Modern `.mdc` supports multiple rule files (relaxing the merge, changing
   `multipleAgents: cursor` from `none`) and a `globs:` key — can `globs:` carry *any* of the
   scoped-permission intent, or does it only scope rule *activation*? Also: do neutral commands
   become inlined docs or get skipped?

9. **Q9 — Windsurf real format (unverified).** The `.windsurf/config.json` +
   `.windsurf/agents/*.json` layout is inferred from the stub, never checked against a live
   install. Confirm: (a) canonical layout vs `.windsurfrules` / `.windsurf/rules/*.md`;
   (b) any manifest listing all agents; (c) any home for commands; (d) exact `creativity`
   vocabulary (`low/medium/high` vs numeric); (e) whether *any* scoped permission construct
   exists.

10. **Q10 — `externalContext: cursor` cell semantics.** Keep `none` (referencing unsupported;
    inlining captured by the new `contextBundling` row), or reclassify? Needs a decision so
    `CapabilityMatrix.ts` and this doc agree.

**Closed in v2:** v1's Q1 (ClaudeAdapter wrong layout — **confirmed**, now index v2 #4 and
§2 header) · v1's Q9 (OpenCode safety-pattern preset — **moot**: Option A puts safety globs in
content, per locked #5) · the index's open CC-`settings.json`-scoping question (**closed
negative**, §2.6: plugins cannot ship permissions).
